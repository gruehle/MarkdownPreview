# Markdown Preview

A [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension that provides a live preview of markdown documents. 

### Installation

* Select **File > Extension Manager...** (or click the "brick" icon in the toolbar)
* Click **Install from URL...**
* Enter the url of this repo: 
 * For Brackets Sprint 27 (or earlier): https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview/archive/sprint-27.zip
 * For Brackets Sprint 28 (or later): https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview
* Click **Install**

### How To Use
When a markdown document (with extension ".md" or ".markdown") is open, a markdown icon is shown in the 
toolbar at the top of the Brackets window. Click this icon to open the preview panel. The panel can be 
resized vertically.

The preview is updated as you edit the document. You can hover over links to see the href in a tooltip,
or click them to open in your default browser.

By default, the document is rendered as standard Markdown. Hover over the preview area and change the
dropdown to "GitHub-Flavored" to see the Markdown as it would appear in a GitHub issue, pull request, or
comment.
